    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>These are the days of  Elijah<br/>Declaring the Word of the Lord, yes<br/>And these are the days of his servant, Moses<br/>Righteousness being restored<br/>And these are the days of great trial<br/>Of famine and darkness and sword<br/>So we are the voice in the desert crying<br/>Prepare ye the way of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Behold he comes<br/>Riding on a cloud<br/>Shining like the sun<br/>At the trumpet's call<br/>Lift your voice<br/>It's the year of jubilee<br/>Out of Zion's hill salvation comes</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And these are the days of Ezekiel<br/>With dry bones becoming as flesh<br/>And these are the days of his servant, David<br/>Building the temple of praise, yes<br/>And these are the days of the harvest<br/>The fields are all white in the world<br/>And we are the laborers that are in your vineyard<br/>Declaring the word of the Lord </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>There's no God like Jehovah<br/>(Repeat 7x)</lines>
