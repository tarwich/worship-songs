    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All things bright and beautiful,<br/>All creatures great and small,<br/>All things wise and wonderful,<br/>The Lord God made them all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Each little flower that opens,<br/>Each little bird that sings,<br/>He made their glowing colours,<br/>He made their tiny wings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The purple-headed mountain,<br/>The river running by,<br/>The sunset, and the morning<br/>That brightens up the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The cold wind in the winter,<br/>The pleasant summer sun,<br/>The ripe fruits in the garden,<br/>He made them every one.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He gave us eyes to see them,<br/>And lips that we might tell<br/>How great is God Almighty,<br/>Who has made all things well.</lines>
