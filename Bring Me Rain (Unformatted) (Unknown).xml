    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can count a million times<br/>People asking me how I<br/>Can praise You with all that I've gone through<br/>---<br/>The question just amazes me<br/>Can circumstances possibly<br/>Change who I forever am in You<br/>---<br/>Maybe since my life was changed<br/>Long before these rainy days<br/>-<br/>It's never really ever crossed my mind<br/>To turn my back on you, oh Lord<br/>-<br/>My only shelter from the storm<br/>But instead I draw closer through these times<br/>So I pray<br/>---<br/>Bring me joy, bring me peace<br/>Bring the chance to be free<br/>Bring me anything that brings You glory<br/>-<br/>And I know there'll be days<br/>When this life brings me pain<br/>But if that's what it takes to praise You<br/>Jesus, bring the rain<br/>---<br/>I am Yours regardless of<br/>The dark clouds that may loom above<br/>-<br/>Because You are much greater than my pain<br/>You who made a way for me<br/>-<br/>By suffering Your destiny<br/>So tell me what's a little rain<br/>So I pray<br/>-<br/>Holy, holy, holy<br/>Is the Lord God Almighty</lines>
