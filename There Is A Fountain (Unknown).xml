    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a fountain filled with blood <br/>drawn from Emmanuel's veins; <br/>and sinners plunged beneath that flood <br/>lose all their guilty stains. <br/>Lose all their guilty stains, <br/>lose all their guilty stains; <br/>and sinners plunged beneath that flood <br/>lose all their guilty stains. <br/>The dying thief rejoiced to see <br/>that fountain in his day; <br/>and there may I, though vile as he, <br/>wash all my sins away.<br/>Wash all my sins away, <br/>wash all my sins away; <br/>and there may I, though vile as he, <br/>wash all my sins away. <br/>E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream <br/>thy flowing wounds supply, <br/>redeeming love has been my theme, <br/>and shall be till I die. <br/>And shall be till I die, <br/>and shall be till I die; <br/>redeeming love has been my theme, <br/>and shall be till I die. </lines>
