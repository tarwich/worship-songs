      <lines>Down at the Cross where my Savior died<br/>Down where the cleansing from sin I cried<br/>-<br/>There to my heart was the Blood applied<br/>Glory to His name<br/>-<br/>I am so wondrously saved from sin<br/>Jesus so sweetly abides within<br/>-<br/>There at the Cross where He took me in<br/>Glory to His Name<br/>-<br/>Come to this fountain so rich and sweet<br/>Cast thy poor soul at the Savior's feet<br/>-<br/>Plunge in today and be made complete<br/>Glory to His Name<br/>-<br/>Glory to His Name, glory to HIs Name<br/>There to my heart was the Blood applied<br/>Glory to His Name</lines>
