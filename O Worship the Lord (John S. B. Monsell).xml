    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,<br/>Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;<br/>With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness,<br/>Kneel and adore Him; the Lord is His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness, <br/>High on His heart He will bear it for thee, <br/>Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness, <br/>Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness <br/>Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine; <br/>Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness, <br/>These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,<br/>He will accept for the name that is dear;<br/>Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,<br/>Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, <br/>Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim; <br/>With gold of obedience and incense of lowliness, <br/>Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.</lines>
