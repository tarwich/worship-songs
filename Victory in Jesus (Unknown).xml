    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard an old, old story, <br/>How a Savior came from glory<br/>How He gave His life on Calvary <br/>To save a wretch like me<br/>I heard about His groaning <br/>Of His precious blood's atoning<br/>Then I repented of my sins <br/>And won the victory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I heard about His healing, <br/>Of His cleansing power revealing<br/>How He made the lame to walk again <br/>And caused the blind to see<br/>And then I cried "Dear Jesus, <br/>Come and heal my broken spirit<br/>And somehow Jesus came <br/>And brought to me the victory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion <br/>He has built for me in glory<br/>And I heard about the streets of gold <br/>Beyond the crystal sea<br/>About the angels singing <br/>And the old redemption story<br/>And some sweet day <br/>I'll sing up there the song of victory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O victory in Jesus my Savior, forever<br/>He sought me and bought me <br/>With His redeeming blood<br/>He loved me ere I knew Him, <br/>And all my love is due Him<br/>He plunged me to victory <br/>Beneath the cleansing flood</lines>
    </verse>
