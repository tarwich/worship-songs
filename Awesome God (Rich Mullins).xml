    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When He rolls up His sleeves <br/>He ain't just puttin' on the ritz.<br/>Our God is an awesome God!<br/>There is thunder in His footsteps <br/>And lightning in His fists.<br/>Our God is an awesome God.<br/>And the Lord wasn't jokin' <br/>When He kicked 'em out of Eden.<br/>It wasn't for no reason <br/>That He shed His blood.<br/>His return is very close <br/>So you better be believin' <br/>That our God is an Awesome God.</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God is an awesome God <br/>He reigns from heaven above<br/>With wisdom power and love<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And when the sky was starless<br/>In the void of the night<br/>Our God is an awesome God<br/>He spoke into the darkness<br/>And created a light<br/>Our God is an awesome God<br/>The judgement and wrath <br/>He poured out on Sodom<br/>The mercy and grace<br/>He gave us at the cross<br/>I hope that we have not<br/>Too quickly forgotten<br/>That our God is an awesome God</lines>
