    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Above all powers, Above all kings<br/>Above all nature And all created things<br/>Above all wisdom And all the ways of man<br/>You were here before the world began</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Above all kingdoms, Above all thrones<br/>Above all wonders The world has ever known<br/>Above all wealth And treasures of the earth<br/>There's no way To measure what you're worth</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crucified, laid behind a stone<br/>You lived to die, rejected and alone<br/>Like a rose, trampled on the ground<br/>You took the fall,and thought of me<br/>Above all</lines>
    </verse>
