      <lines>Some-times, in our lives 	   <br/>We all have pain, we all have sorrow<br/>But, if we are wise 		<br/>We know that there's always tomorrow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Lean on me, when you're not strong<br/>I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on<br/>For, it won't be long  <br/>Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean on</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Please, swallow your pride     <br/>If I have things, you need to borrow<br/>For, no one can fill    <br/>Those of your needs, that you won't let show</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>You just call on me brother when you need a hand<br/>We all need somebody to lean on<br/>I just might have a problem that you'll understand<br/>We all need somebody to lean on </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If there is a load       <br/>You have to bear, that you can't carry<br/>I'm right up the road     <br/>I'll share your load if you just call me</lines>
