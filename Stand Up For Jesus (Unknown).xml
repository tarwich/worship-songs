    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus<br/>Ye soldiers of the cross<br/>Lift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss<br/>From victory unto victory His army shall He lead<br/>Till every foe is vanquished<br/>And Christ is Lord indeed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus<br/>The trumpet call obey<br/>Forth to the mighty conflict<br/>In this, His glorious day<br/>Ye that are men now serve Him<br/>Against unnumbered foes<br/>Let courage rise with danger<br/>And strength to strength oppose</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus<br/>Stand in His strength alone<br/>The arm of flesh will fail you<br/>Ye dare not trust your own<br/>Put on the gospel armour<br/>Each piece put on with prayer<br/>Where duty calls or danger<br/>Be never wanting there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus<br/>The strife will not be long<br/>This day the noise of battle<br/>The next the victor's song<br/>To Him that overcometh<br/>A crown of life shall be<br/>He with the King of glory<br/>Shall reign eternally</lines>
    </verse>
