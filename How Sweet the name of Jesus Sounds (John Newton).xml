    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds<br/>In a believer’s ear!<br/>It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,<br/>And drives away his fear.<br/>It makes the wounded spirit whole,<br/>And calms the troubled breast;<br/>’Tis manna to the hungry soul,<br/>And to the weary, rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Dear name, the rock on which I build,<br/>My shield and hiding place,<br/>My never-failing treasury, filled<br/>With boundless stores of grace!<br/>Jesus! My Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,<br/>My Prophet, Priest and King,<br/>My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,<br/>Accept the praise I bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Weak is the effort of my heart,<br/>And cold my warmest thought;<br/>But when I see Thee as Thou art,<br/>I’ll praise Thee as I ought.<br/>Till then I would Thy love proclaim<br/>With every fleeting breath;<br/>And may the music of Thy name<br/>Refresh my soul in death.</lines>
