    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come to the garden alone<br/>He speaks and the sound of His voice<br/>I'd stay in the garden with Him<br/>-<br/>While the dew is still on the roses<br/>Is so sweet the birds hush their singing<br/>Though the night around me be falling<br/>-<br/>And the voice I hear, falling on my ear<br/>Adn the melody that He gave to me<br/>But He bids me go: Through the voice of woe<br/>-<br/>The Son of God discloses<br/>Within my heart is ringing<br/>His voice to me is calling<br/>-<br/>And He walks with me, and He talks with me<br/>And He tells me I am His own<br/>-<br/>And the joy wae share as we tarry there<br/>None other has ever known</lines>
