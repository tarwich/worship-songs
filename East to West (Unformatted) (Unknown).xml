      <lines>Here I am Lord and I'm drowning<br/>In your sea of forgetfulness<br/>The chains of yesterday surround me<br/>-<br/>I yearn for peace and rest<br/>I don't want to end up where you found me<br/>-<br/>And it echoes in my mind<br/>Keeps me awake tonight<br/>---<br/>I know you've cast my sins as far<br/>As the East is from the West<br/>-<br/>And I stand before you now<br/>As though I've never sinned but today<br/>-<br/>I feel like I'm just one mistake away<br/>From you leaving me this way<br/>---<br/>Jesus can you show me<br/>Just how far the East is from the West<br/>-<br/>Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been<br/>Come rising up in me again<br/>-<br/>In the arms of your mercy I find rest<br/>Cause you know just how far the East is from the West<br/>From one scarred hand to the other<br/>---<br/>I start the day the war begins<br/>-<br/>Endless reminding of my sin<br/>Time and time again<br/>-<br/>Your [T]ruth is drowned out by the storm I'm in<br/>Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away<br/>From you leaving me this way<br/><br/>(chorus)<br/>----<br/><br/>I know you've washed me white<br/>Turned my darkness into light<br/>-<br/>I need your peace to get me through<br/>To get me through this night<br/>-<br/>I can't live by what I feel<br/>But by the truth your word reveals<br/>-<br/>I'm not holding on to you<br/>But your holding on to me<br/>Your holding on to me<br/>---<br/>Jesus, you know just how far<br/>The East is from the West<br/>-<br/>I don't have to see the man I've been<br/>Come rising up in me again<br/>-<br/>In the arms of your mercy I find rest<br/>(The arms of your mercy I find rest)<br/>-<br/>Cause you know just how far the East is from the West<br/>From one scarred hand to the other(x2)<br/>-<br/>(Just how far, the East is from the West) (x3)<br/>From one scarred hand to the other</lines>
