    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I serve a risen Savior He's in the world today<br/>I know that He is living whatever men may say<br/>-<br/>I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer<br/>And just the time I need Him He's always near<br/>-<br/>He lives- He lives- Christ Jesus lives today<br/>He walks with me and talks with me, along lifes narrow way<br/>-<br/>He lives- He lives- Christ Jesus lives today<br/>You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart<br/>-<br/>In all thw wolrd around me I see His loving care<br/>And though my heart grows weary I never will despair<br/>-<br/>I know that He is leading through all the stormy blast<br/>The day of His appearing will come at last<br/>-<br/>Rejoice, rejoice O Christian, lift up your voice and sing<br/>Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King<br/>-<br/>The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find<br/>None other is so loving, so good and kind</lines>
