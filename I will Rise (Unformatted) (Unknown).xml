    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a peace I've come to know <br/>Though my heart and flesh may fail <br/>-<br/>There's an anchor for my soul <br/>I can say "It is well" <br/>-<br/>Jesus has overcome <br/>And the grave is overwhelmed <br/>-<br/>The victory is won <br/>He is risen from the dead <br/>----<br/>And I will rise when He calls my name <br/>No more sorrow, no more pain <br/>-<br/>I will rise on eagles' wings <br/>Before my God fall on my knees <br/>And rise, I will rise <br/>----<br/>There's a day that's drawing near <br/>When this darkness breaks to light <br/>-<br/>And the shadows disappear <br/>And my faith shall be my eyes <br/>-<br/>Jesus has overcome <br/>And the grave is overwhelmed <br/>-<br/>The victory is won <br/>He is risen from the dead <br/>-<br/>(chorus 1X)<br/>---<br/>And I hear the voice of many angels sing, <br/>"Worthy is the Lamb" <br/>-<br/>And I hear the cry of every longing heart, <br/>"Worthy is the Lamb" <br/>[x2]<br/><br/>(CHORUS) </lines>
