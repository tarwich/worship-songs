      <lines>Mary did you know, that your baby boy would someday walk on water?<br/>Mary did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters<br/>Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?<br/>This child that you've delivered will soon deliver you<br/>Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man<br/>Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?<br/>Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?<br/>When you've kissed your little baby then you've kissed the face of God<br/>The blind will see, the deaf will heard, the dead will live again<br/>The lame will leap, the dumb will speak the praises of the Lamb<br/>Mary did you know that your baby boy is the Lord of all creation<br/>Mary did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations?<br/>Did you know that your baby boy was heavn's perfect lamb?<br/>This sleeping child you're holding is the great I AM</lines>
