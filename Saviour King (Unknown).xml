    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And now the weak say I have strength<br/>By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead<br/>And now the poor stand and confess<br/>That my portion is Him and I'm more than blessed<br/>Let now our hearts burn with a flame<br/>A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name<br/>And with the heavens we declare<br/>You are our king<br/>We love you Lord, we worship you<br/>You are our God, you alone are good<br/>You asked your Son to carry this<br/>The heavy cross our weight of sin<br/>I love you Lord, I worship you<br/>Hope which was lost, now stands renewed<br/>I give my life to honor this<br/>The love of Christ, the savior king<br/>Let now your church shine as the bride<br/>That you soar in your heart as you offered up your life<br/>Let now the lost be welcomed home<br/>By the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own<br/>I give my life to honor this<br/>The love of Christ, the savior king</lines>
