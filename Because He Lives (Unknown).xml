    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God sent His son, they called Him Jesus<br/>He came to love, heal, and forgive<br/>He lived and died to buy my pardon<br/>An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives<br/>Because He lives, I can face tomorrow<br/>Because He lives, all fear is gone<br/>And life is worth the living<br/>Just because He lives</lines>
