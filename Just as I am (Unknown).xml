    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Just as I am without one plea, but that Thy blood was shed for me<br/>And that Thou biddest me come to Thee<br/>Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come<br/>Just as I am waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot<br/>To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot<br/>Oh, Lamb of God, I come, I come<br/>Just as I am though tossed about<br/>With many a conflict many a doubt<br/>Fighting and fears without, without<br/>Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come<br/>Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind<br/>Sight, riches, healing of the mind<br/>Yea, all I need, in Thee I find, Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come<br/>Just as I am, Thou wilt recieve<br/>Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieave<br/>Because Thy promise I believe<br/>Oh Lamb of God, I come, I come</lines>
