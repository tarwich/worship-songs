    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br/>Jack Frost nipping at your nose<br/>Yuletide carols being sung by a choir<br/>And folks dressed up like Eskimos.......<br/>Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe<br/>Help to make the season bright<br/>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow<br/>Will find it hard to sleep tonight<br/>They know that Santa's on his way<br/>He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh<br/>And every mother's child is gonna spy<br/>To see if reindeer really know how to fly<br/>And so I'm offering this simple phrase<br/>To kids from one to ninety-two<br/>Although it's been said many times, many ways<br/>Merry Christmas to you</lines>
