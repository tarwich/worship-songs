    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades<br/>And all is stripped away <br/>and I simply come<br/>Longing just to bring <br/>something that's of worth<br/>That will bless your heart<br/>I'll bring you more than a song <br/>for a song in itself<br/>Is not what you have required. <br/>You search much deeper within<br/>Through the way things appear. <br/>You're looking into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm coming back to the heart of worship<br/>And it's all about you, all about you, Jesus<br/>I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it<br/>When it's all about you, all about you, Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth<br/>No one could express how much you deserve<br/>Though I'm weak and poor<br/>All I have is yours, every single breath</lines>
