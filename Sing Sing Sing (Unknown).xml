    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We will sing, sing, sing <br/>And make music with the heavens <br/>We will sing, sing, sing <br/>Grateful that You hear us <br/>When we shout your praise <br/>Lift high the name of Jesus </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What's not to love about You? <br/>Heaven and earth adore You <br/>Kings and kingdoms bow down <br/>Son of God, You are the One <br/>You are the One we're living for </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You are the love that frees us <br/>You are the light that leads us <br/>Like a fire burning <br/>Son of God, You are the one <br/>You are the one we're living for</lines>
