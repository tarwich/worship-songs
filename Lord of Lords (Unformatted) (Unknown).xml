    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Beholding your beauty is all I long for<br/>To worship You Jesus with my soul's desire<br/>For this very heart you've shaped for your pleasure<br/>The purpose to lift your name high<br/>Hear and surrender in pure adoration<br/>I enter your courts with an offering of praise<br/>I am Your servant come to bring you glory<br/>As is fit for the work of your hands<br/>Now unto the lamb who sits on the throne<br/>Be glory and honor and praise<br/>All of creation resounds with the song<br/>Worship and praise him the Lord of Lords<br/>The spirit now living and dwelling within me<br/>Keep my eyes fixed ever upon Jesus' face<br/>Let not the things of this world ever sway me<br/>I'll run 'till I finish the race<br/>Holy Lord<br/>You are Holy<br/>Jesus Christ is the Lord<br/>Lord of Lords (2x)</lines>
