    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come Holy Spirit. Fill our hearts and <br/>kindle them in the fire of Your love.<br/>Send forth your Spirit, <br/>and they shall be created<br/>And you shall renew the face of the earth<br/>Oh God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit, <br/>instructs the hearts of the faithful.<br/>Grant that by the same Holy Spirit, <br/>we may be truly wise.<br/>And ever rejoice in his consolation <br/>through Christ our Lord. Amen.<br/>I believe, Lord, that You are here present.<br/>Although my eyes do not see you, <br/>my faith senses you.<br/>Take any stray thoughts from my mind. <br/>Make me understand the truths <br/>that you wish to teach me in this meditation.<br/>Let me make up my mind to put them into practice.<br/>Your servant is listening. Speak o Lord to my soul.<br/>We give thanks, Lord God Almighty, <br/>for all the benefits You have given us. <br/>To You who live and reign forever and ever. Amen.</lines>
