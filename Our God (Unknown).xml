      <lines>Water you turned into wine, <br/>Opened the eyes of the blind<br/>There's no one like you, <br/>None like You!<br/>Into the darkness you shine <br/>Out of the ashes we rise<br/>There's no one like You <br/>None like You</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God is greater, our God is stronger, <br/>God you are higher than any other<br/>Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power, <br/>Our God! Our God!</lines>

    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>And if our God is for us, <br/>Then who could ever stop us<br/>And if our God is with us, <br/>Then what could stand against<br/>And if our God is for us, <br/>Then who could ever stop us<br/>And if our God is with us, <br/>Then what could stand against<br/>What could stand against</lines>
