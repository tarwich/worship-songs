    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise to the holiest in the height,<br/>And in the depth be praise; <br/>In all His words most wonderful, <br/>Most sure in all His ways.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O loving wisdom of our God! <br/>When all was sin and shame, <br/>A second Adam to the fight <br/>And to the rescue came.<br/>O wisest love! that flesh and blood, <br/>Which did in Adam fail, <br/>Should strive afresh against the foe, <br/>Should strive and should prevail;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And that a higher gift than grace <br/>Should flesh and blood refine,<br/>Godâ€™s presence and His very self, <br/>And essence all-divine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O generous love! that He, who smote <br/>In Man for man the foe, <br/>The double agony in Man <br/>For man should undergo;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And in the garden secretly, <br/>And on the cross on high, <br/>Should teach His brethren, and inspire <br/>To suffer and to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Praise to the Holiest in the height,<br/>And to the depth be praise;<br/>In all His words most wonderful,<br/>Most sure in all His ways.</lines>
