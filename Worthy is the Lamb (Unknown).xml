    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thank you for the cross, Lord.<br/>Thank you for the price you paid.<br/>Bearing all my sin and shame, in love you came<br/>And gave Amazing Grace.<br/>Thank you for this love, Lord.<br/>Thank you for the nail-pierced hands.<br/>Wash me in Your cleansing flow, now all I know<br/>Your forgiveness and embrace.<br/>Worthy is the Lamb<br/>seated on the throne.<br/>We crown You now with many crowns<br/>You reign victorious!<br/>High and lifted up<br/>Jesus, Son of God.<br/>The darling of Heaven, crucified...<br/>Worthy is the Lamb.</lines>
