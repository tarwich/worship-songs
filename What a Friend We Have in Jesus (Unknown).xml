    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a friend we have in Jesus, <br/>All ours sins and griefs to bear,<br/>What a privilege to carry <br/>Everything to God in prayer!<br/>O what peace we often forfeit, <br/>O what needless pain we bear,<br/>All because we do not carry <br/>Everything to God in prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Have we trials and temptations? <br/>Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>We should never be discouraged; <br/>Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>Can we find a friend so faithful <br/>Who will all our sorrows share?<br/>Jesus knows our every weakness; <br/>Take it to the Lord in prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Are we weak and heavy laden, <br/>Cumbered with a load of care?<br/>Precious Saviour still our refuge; <br/>Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>Do thy friends despise forsake thee? <br/>Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee; <br/>Thou wilt find a solace there.</lines>
