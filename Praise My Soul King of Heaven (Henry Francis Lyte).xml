    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;<br/>To His feet thy tribute bring. <br/>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, <br/>Who like thee His praise should sing? <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise the everlasting King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise Him for His grace and favour <br/>To our fathers in distress; <br/>Praise Him, still the same forever, <br/>Slow to chide, and swift to bless. <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Glorious in His faithfulness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Father-like, He tends and spares us; <br/>Well our feeble frame He knows; <br/>In His hands He gently bears us, <br/>Rescues us from all our foes. <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Widely as His mercy flows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angels in the height, adore Him; <br/>Ye behold Him face to face; <br/>Sun and moon, bow down before Him, <br/>Dwellers all in time and space. <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise Him! Praise Him! <br/>Praise with us the God of grace!</lines>
