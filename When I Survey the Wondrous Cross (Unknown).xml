    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I survey the wondrous cross<br/>On which the Prince of Glory died<br/>My richest gain I count but loss<br/>And pour contempt on all my pride<br/>See from His head, His hands, His feet<br/>Sorrow and love flow mingled down<br/>Did ever such love and sorrow meet<br/>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?<br/>Were the whole realm of nature mine<br/>That were an offering far too small<br/>Love so amazing, so divine<br/>Demands my soul, my life, my all</lines>
