    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing a song of celebration<br/>Lift up a shout of praise<br/>For the Bridegroom will come<br/>The Glorious One<br/>And Oh -- We will look on His Face<br/>We'll go to a much better place<br/>Dance with all your might<br/>Lift up your hands and clap for joy <br/>The time's drawing near, when He will appear<br/>And oh we will stand by His side<br/>A strong, pure spotless bride<br/>We will dance on the streets that are golden<br/>The glorious bride, and the Great Son of Man<br/>Every tongue and tribe and nation<br/>Will join in the Song of the Lamb<br/>Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near<br/>The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear<br/>The wedding feast to come is now near at hand<br/>Lift up your voice, proclaim thew coming Lamb</lines>
