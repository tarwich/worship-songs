    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades <br/>And all is stripped away <br/>And I simply come <br/>Longing just to bring <br/>Something that's of worth <br/>That will bless your heart </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I'll bring You more than a song <br/>For a song in itself <br/>Is not what You have required <br/>You search much deeper within <br/>Through the ways things appear <br/>You're looking into my heart </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm coming back to the heart of worship <br/>And it's all about You <br/>All about You, Jesus <br/>I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it <br/>When it's all about You <br/>It's all about You Jesus </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth <br/>No one could express <br/>How much You deserve <br/>Though I'm weak and poor <br/>All I have is Yours <br/>Every single breath </lines>
