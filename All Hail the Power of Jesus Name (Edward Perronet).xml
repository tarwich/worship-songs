    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,<br/>Who from His altar call;<br/>Extol Him in whose path ye trod,<br/>And crown Him Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,<br/>Ye ransomed of the fall,<br/>Hail Him who saves you by His grace,<br/>And crown Him Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget<br/>The wormwood and the gall,<br/>Go, spread your trophies at His feet,<br/>And crown Him Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Let every kindred, every tribe<br/>On this terrestrial ball,<br/>To Him all majesty ascribe,<br/>And crown Him Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>O that, with yonder sacred throng,<br/>We at His feet may fall,<br/>Join in the everlasting song,<br/>And crown Him Lord of all!</lines>
