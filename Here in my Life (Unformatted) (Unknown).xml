    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have never walked on water <br/>felt the waves beneath my feet but <br/>-<br/>at Your word Lord, I'll receive Your <br/>faith to walk on oceans deep <br/>-<br/>and I remember how You found me <br/>in the very same place <br/>-<br/>all my failings surely would have drowned me <br/>still You made a way <br/>---<br/>You are my freedom <br/>Jesus, You're the reason <br/>-<br/>I'm kneeling again at Your throne <br/>where would I be without You here in my life <br/>here in my life <br/>-----<br/>You have said that all the heavens <br/>sing for joy at one who finds the <br/>-<br/>way to freedom, truth of Jesus <br/>bought from death into His life <br/>-<br/>and I remember how You saw me  <br/>and though the cost was Your beloved for me <br/>still You made a way</lines>
