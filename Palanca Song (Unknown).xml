    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Now my sponsor did take me to Tres Dias<br/>He told me I'd pray and cry all the day<br/>I've sat till I hurt and my bottoms all numb now<br/>Why did you leave me and go far away<br/>Where oh where, are you tonight?<br/>Why did you leave me here all alone?<br/>I came to this weekennd a draggin' my feet<br/>You sang "De Colores" and you were gone!<br/>They told us to hush for most of the first night<br/>But they just went right on talking themselves.<br/>I feel like I might have been purt near brain washed<br/>Cuz now I come runnin at the sound of a bell<br/>Where oh where, are you tonight?<br/>Why did you leave me here all alone?<br/>I came to this weekennd a draggin' my feet<br/>You sang "De Colores" and you were gone!<br/>My stomach's all hurtin' with the fill of much candy<br/>I've ate till I'm sick at the sight of some gum<br/>I am constipated and scared to stand up now<br/>Pass me the xlax and watch me go run<br/>Where oh where, are you tonight?<br/>Why did you leave me here all alone?<br/>I came to this weekennd a draggin' my feet<br/>You sang "De Colores" and you were gone!<br/>The table of Peter looks like an explosion<br/>There's raisins and snickers and cashews and stuff<br/>There's coolers of ice cream and bars of milk chocolate<br/>When will they say that enough is enough?<br/>Where oh where, are you tonight?<br/>Why did you leave me here all alone?<br/>I came to this weekennd a draggin' my feet<br/>You sang "De Colores" and you were gone!<br/>The weekend's most over; my eyes are most swollen<br/>The rector held so tight in his arms<br/>He told me we were a child of our father<br/>Jesus died for us so we could live on</lines>
